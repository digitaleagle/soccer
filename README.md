Soccer Team Manager

This is a multi-platform application designed to help manage a soccer team, particularly for the [Plant City Soccer League](https://www.plantcitygov.com/parksrec/page/youth-soccer-league-ages-4-18).  The league is non-competitive, which requires that each player must play at least half of each game.  This helps me track and plan to make that happen.  It also saves me time contacting the players to make sure they know when games and practices are.

## Features

- Store team players, contact info, and position prefernces
- Store game/practice dates, times, and details
- Track game and practice attendance
- Plan player positions and playing time by quarter in games
- Track communication with players
- Automatically send SMS to each player

## Home Screen

The home screen lists all of the upcomming events (games and practices).  Tap on the game or practice that you want to work.
