## DigitalEagle Soccer: Privacy policy

Welcome to the DigitalEagle Soccer app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Stephen Phillips to help manage his personal
soccer team for the Plant City, FL Soccer league. The source code is available on GitHub under 
the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play in the hopes that it might help
other coaches.

I do not want your data! I don't have the capacity to store other people's information and do not
want to collect it. All data created by you is stored on your device only,
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.  The app does have the ability
to export the data, but it is up to you to control where that data goes and keep that protected. Otherwise,
all data is save in local storage on the device and not sent out to the Internet.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any
question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will
surely try to fix it/help you.

Thanks,

Stephen Phillips.
Plant City, Florida.
